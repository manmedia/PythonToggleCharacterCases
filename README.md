# PythonToggleCharacterCases
This is a Python module that toggles the case of each character to either upper or lower (respective to their original position). The module has only one function process_files() that takes a dictionary argument "args" (provied by get_parsed_args) and outputs a success message when it's all done. Standard exceptions were used to handle errors and exception.
